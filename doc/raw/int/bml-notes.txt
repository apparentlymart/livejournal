TEMPLATE FLAGS
==============
This documents the flags in braces at the beginning of .look
file block template definitions.  The flags fall into one
of three classes:

1) Varible definition types:

   F: full, mix of multi & single line property definitions:

       (=TEMPLATE
       <=FOO
       Multi
       line
       string
       <=FOO
       BAR=>Single line string
       TEMPLATE=)

   P: pipe delimited, properites are named DATA<n>, where <n> starts at
      1 and increases.

        (=TEMPLATE DATA1|second arg|DATA3 TEMPLATE=)

   D: one proprety, and it's named DATA

        (=TEMPLATE I am the DATA TEMPLATE=)


2) Static template definitions:

   S: static: output won't have more BML to expand, or properties to fill-in, 
      so don't try.

   R: less static: add pRoperties, but then don't BML expand.

3) Controlling expansion vs. interpolation order:

   p: pre-parsed.  BML-expand parameters first, then interpolate into
      template.  by default, parameters are interpolated first, then
      everything is expanded.  but if you use %%TITLE%% twice in your
      PAGE, for example, and your .bml file defines TITLE=> with a
      _CODE block, it will be run twice, so it's generally a good idea
      to make PAGE definitions pre-parsed.  also, then, you avoid
      re-running most of your output through the BML expander a second
      time.
 
   s: expand embedded parameterless static blocks in definition early.
      so when the template file is read, any blocks of the form (=FOO=) 
      are expanded ahead of time.  Useful in conjunction with the {S} 
      flag.  consider:

        # Our image server:
        IMGPREFIX=>{S}http://www.site.com:8080/

        # Some block that has an image:
        SPACER=>{Ss}<img src='(=IMGPREFIX=)/spacer.gif' width='1' height='10'>

      The SPACER block isn't really static, but because {s} is used and IMGPREFIX
      is static, then SPACER can also be static.
